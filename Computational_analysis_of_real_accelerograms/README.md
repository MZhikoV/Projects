A procedure for the calculation of frequency and energy characteristics of accelerograms, developed in Matlab workspace.
The accelerograms are selected according to the Eurocode 8 requirements for real accelerogram selection and structural analysis.
Peak and integral characteristics are assessed. The obtained results are verified through comparison with corresponding results,
obtained by processing the same sets of signals using already established software.
